<p>In the "ShopEasy" grocery shopping list app, state management is used to keep track of and update the application's data and user interface based on user interactions and changes in data.  Here's how state management is used in the "ShopEasy" app.</p>

<h1 align="left">What is state?</h1>
<p>In Flutter, state is any data that can change over time and needs to be reflected in the user interface. The core state in the "ShopEasy" app is the list of items in each shopping list. This list can change dynamically as users add or remove items. Each shopping list's contents are an example of state.</p>
